## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric purple (#A259FF). Purple conveys a sense of futuristic wellness. 
- Background color: Dark, slightly desaturated purple (#261747).
- Accent color: Neon cyan (#33A2FF). Cyan is analogous to purple, and its brightness stands out from the primary.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for a modern, tech-inspired look.
- Use neon-style icons for steps, food, sleep, and rewards; all icons should be custom-designed.
- Glassmorphism design: Frosted glass cards with purple neon borders and blurred backgrounds for a futuristic, immersive feel.
- Implement micro-animations, like glowing effects and confetti on badge unlocks, for a gamified experience.
